          My name is G Atak and I am an aerospace engineer. My interest in coding was inspired by the interaction I had with different coding-based software during my course, such as MATLAB, Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Element ANSYS. I have realised knowing how to code will make it easy to write computer programs for the different software I work with. Many times I have been given a code already written in MATLAB, on my many instances it was hard to read and follow the syntax. Although languages like MATLAB is different fron JavaScript, the basic principle is really the same: you get to write functions, variables, arrays and so on. It turned out coding is more exciting and I could actually become a web developer. This will make an al-round person in an engineering firms. I could work as a software developer at one of the biggest aerospacec company in the UK! You never know where such skills and knowledge will take you to.
          This is my third week at the University of Manchester Bootcamp and I am excited about the different projects I am goingto built, some of which you will get to see as you read through my portfolio.
